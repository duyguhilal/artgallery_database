This project includes a comprehensive MySQL database design and management to meet the database needs of an art gallery. In the first stage, complex relationships between artworks, artists, exhibitions and customers were modeled in detail by creating Entity-Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagrams. While ER diagrams show basic relationships, key parts, and connections, EER diagrams also include special cases and inheritance relationships.

Then, using Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, the system design and database relationships were visualized from a general perspective. UML diagrams provided a framework for understanding the abstract and concrete structures of design, including elements such as class diagrams, relationship diagrams, and state diagrams.

The MySQL schema is based on EER diagrams and is designed to effectively manage artworks, artists, exhibitions, and customer information within the gallery. A set of SQL code was developed to support this schema. For example, SQL queries that include functions such as listing works by artists or finding works purchased by customers are among the examples that can be used to manage the database.
